# AlphaPlayground
Calcifire Consulting Private Demo

These demos are feature packages that can be used independently or combined for
use in a larger application.

AlphaChat: You can use this chatbot much like ChatGPT but with the addition of
having knowledge of current events with a google search tool, and leveraging
WolframAlpha for math computation, time, date, and other types of query

AlphaReader: This Reader can accept any filetype as an upload and then
a user can chat with the file asking specific questions relevant to the data
in the file

Alpha Data Vizualizer (Basic): Same as above, but only accepts .csv and .xlsx files
top be queried as well as create simple graphs and charts

Alpha Data Vizualizer (Advanced): Custom Tableau-like interface that allows the user
to visualize the uploaded file and customize interactive graphs and charts
